        <p><b>1973</b>: The Univeristy of Illinois founded a graduate laboratory to increase the study
            and research of virtual reality as well as real-time interactive computer graphics.
        </p>

        <p><b>1993</b>: The movie Jurassic Park became the first movie to sucessfully showcase 3D images at
            film resolution. Computer-generated (CGI) had made many improvments since then.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1994</b>: The Mosaic Browser was the first graphic user-friendly interface web browser
            developped and distrubuted to the general public.
        </p>
        <p><b>1995</b>: "Vision of the Future" was a project developped in aim to design electronical products
            by incomporating quality-of-life considerations into the design process.
        </p>
        <p><b>1995-2000</b>: Developppment in examining and improving the intersection of
            computer science, humanities and the arts by the Computer Science and Telecommunications

        <ul>
            <li> Computer science: According to<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/computer-science"
                    target="_blank">britannica</a>
                the study of computers and computing,
                includes the study of algorithms and data structures, computer and network design,
                modeling data and information processes, and artificial intelligence.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Visual arts: While visual arts is a medium to express emotions, objetcs, events through the
                creations of ceramics, drawing, painting and sculpture; it also commonly used in applied arts such as
                industrial design, graphic design, fashion design and interior design.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Digital media: According to the journalist, Dalia Goldberg, Digital media is binary data transformed to
                broadcast and spread information.
                Digital media can be translated to audio, video, graphics etc in aim to offer a user-friendly
                experience.

            <br>
            <li>
                Computer Graphics: A process which transforms information into visual form. The aim is to represent
                imagery and 3D modeling by using specific software and considering realistic details such as
                lighting, reflection and texture.

    <div id="pros-cons" class="content">

        <span>Disadvantages</span>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Digital Artists are more likley to get employed than traditional illustrators and cartoonists.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-top: 1em;">
                AI raises an ethical and a social concern since its use may create bais, discriminate an minority
                and even spread false information.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <span style="margin-top: 6em;">Advantages</span>
        <ul style="margin-top: 9.5em">
            <li>
                AI encourages cross-interdisplinary projects and research. Engineers and artists work together to build
                and envision new realities.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-top: 1em;">

        <span>Creativity with AI</span>
        <div id="AI-text" style="padding-top: 5%;">
            <p>The expression "expressive AI" makes use of an combination of art Studio practices
                and AI to build new projects or develop new research purposes. It is commonly used in artificial
                intelligence, in the arts and in cultural fields in order to allow the audience to interact with the artists creation. </p>
            <p> AI is conssidered to be a useful tool to improve sensors and actuators. For example,
                when light sensitive sensors are attached to a human body, these specks of lights are captured by several
                cameras.
                The final result is stored data representing the movments of the human body. A system will then analyse
                and
                intrepret the information to create an virtual preformance.
            </p>
            <p> Another facinating project developped with the help of AI is the "Terminal Time",
                a system which builds historical documentary based upon the audience response to a list of question.
                During the show, the audience are asked a few generated questions. The show will continue its story
                according
                to answers given by the majority. </p>
