                        lighting, reflection and texture.

                <p class="history-paragraph">The expression "Expressive AI" makes use of an combination of Art Studio practices
                    and AI to build new projects or develop new research purposes. It is commonly used in artificial
                    intelligence, in the arts and in cultural fields in order to allow the audience to interact with the artists creation. </p>
                <br>
                    <p class="history-paragraph"> AI is considered to be a useful tool to improve sensors and actuators. For example,
                    when light sensitive sensors are attached to a human body, these specks of lights are captured by several
                    cameras.
                    The final result is stored data representing the movments of the human body. A system will then analyse
                    and
                    intrepret the information to create an virtual preformance.

                <br>
                <p class="history-paragraph"> Another facinating project developped with the help of AI is the "Terminal Time",
                    a system which builds historical documentary based upon the audience response to a list of question.
                    During the show, the audience are asked a few generated questions. The show will continue its story
                    according
                    to answers given by the majority. </p>
